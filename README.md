# Inverted-Pendulum
Regulation of an inverted pendulum on a moving cart using a _linearâ€“quadratic regulator_ (LQR). The parameters that characterize the dynamic system are estimated using system identification methods.

A Kalman filter is also implemented to estimate the internal states of the system and reduce the number of sensors required.
